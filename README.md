More than 20,000 companies around the world use Ansible as their Infrastructure as Code and configuration management tool. With the rising popularity towards managing infrastructure using IaC and config management tools, Ansible is one of the best open source tools to choose from.

That is why we are excited to announce a new Grafana Ansible collection available to all Grafana Cloud users, including those in the generous free tier. (If you donâ€™t already have a Grafana Cloud account, you can sign up for free today!). The new Grafana Ansible collection supports managing various resources in Grafana Cloud, such as plugins, dashboards, API keys, and much more.

How to install the Grafana Ansible collection for Grafana Cloud
The Grafana Ansible collection is available on Ansible Galaxy.

You can install the collection using the command below:

More modules will be added as we grow the Grafana Ansible collection.
