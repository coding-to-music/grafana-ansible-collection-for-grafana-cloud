# How to get started with the new Grafana Ansible collection for Grafana Cloud

By Ishan Jain

More than 20,000 companies around the world use Ansible as their Infrastructure as Code and configuration management tool. With the rising popularity towards managing infrastructure using IaC and config management tools, Ansible is one of the best open source tools to choose from.

That is why we are excited to announce a new Grafana Ansible collection available to all Grafana Cloud users, including those in the generous free tier. (If you donâ€™t already have a Grafana Cloud account, you can sign up for free today!). The new Grafana Ansible collection supports managing various resources in Grafana Cloud, such as plugins, dashboards, API keys, and much more.

# How to install the Grafana Ansible collection for Grafana Cloud

The Grafana Ansible collection is available on Ansible Galaxy.

You can install the collection using the command below:

```java
ansible-galaxy collection install grafana.grafana
```

To install a particular version of the Ansible collection, use the command below:

```java
ansible-galaxy collection install grafana.grafana:1.0.0
```

You can also include it in a requirements.yml file and install it via

```java
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

using the format:

```java
yaml

---

collections:

- name: grafana.grafana
```

# Grafana Ansible collection modules

The Grafana Ansible collection currently has eight modules. These modules are currently offered to manage resources on Grafana Cloud only:

- grafana.grafana.alert_contact_point - Manage Grafana Alerting contact points in Grafana.
- grafana.grafana.alert_notification_policy - Sets the notification policy tree in Grafana Alerting.
- grafana.grafana.cloud_api_key â€“ Manage Grafana Cloud API keys.
- grafana.grafana.cloud_plugin â€“ Manage Grafana Cloud plugins.
- grafana.grafana.cloud_stack â€“ Manage Grafana Cloud stack.
- grafana.grafana.dashboard â€“ Manage dashboards in Grafana.
- grafana.grafana.datasource â€“ Manage data sources in Grafana.
- grafana.grafana.folder â€“ Manage folders in Grafana.

More modules will be added as we grow the Grafana Ansible collection.

# Start using the Grafana Ansible collection

Once you have the Grafana Ansible collection installed, you can start using the modules available in the collection. You can call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as grafana.grafana.cloud_stack:

```java
- name: Using grafana collection
  hosts: localhost
  tasks: - name: Create a Grafana Cloud stack
  grafana.grafana.cloud_stack:
  name: mystack
  stack_slug: mystack
  org_slug: myorg
  cloud_api_key: "{{ cloud_api_key }}"
  region: eu
  state: present
```

You can learn more by reading the documentation for the Grafana Ansible collection.

# Install or uninstall Grafana Alloy using Ansible

You can use the Grafana Ansible Collection to install and manage Alloy on Linux hosts.

### Before you begin

These steps assume you already have a working Ansible setup and a pre-existing inventory.
You can add the tasks below to any new or existing role.

Steps

To add Alloy to a host:

Create a file named `alloy.yml` and add the following:

```yaml
- name: Install Alloy
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks: - name: Install Alloy
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
  name: grafana.grafana.alloy
  vars:
  config: |
  prometheus.scrape "default" {
  targets = [{"__address__" = "localhost:12345"}]
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.prom.receiver]
  }
  prometheus.remote_write "prom" {
    endpoint {
    url = "<YOUR_PROMETHEUS_PUSH_ENDPOINT>"
      }
    }
```

This snippet has a sample configuration to collect and send Alloy metrics to Prometheus

Replace the following:

`<YOUR_PROMETHEUS_PUSH_ENDPOINT>`: The Remote write endpoint of your Prometheus Instance.

Run the Ansible playbook. Open a terminal window and run the following command from the Ansible playbook directory.

```java
ansible-playbook alloy.yml
```

Validate

To verify that the Alloy service on the target machine is active and running, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status alloy.service
```

If the service is active and running, the output should look similar to this:

```java
alloy.service - Grafana Alloy
  Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/alloy.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
  Active: active (running) since Wed 2022-07-20 09:56:15 UTC; 36s ago
Main PID: 3176 (alloy-linux-amd)
  Tasks: 8 (limit: 515)
  Memory: 92.5M
    CPU: 380ms
  CGroup: /system.slice/alloy.service
    â””â”€3176 /usr/local/bin/alloy-linux-amd64 --config.file=/etc/grafana-cloud/alloy-config.yaml
```
